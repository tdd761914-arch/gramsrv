# gramsrv - Open Source Telegram Server / MTProto Server in Go

`gramsrv` is an open-source Telegram server implementation and MTProto server
written in Go. It is a Telegram-like backend for real client compatibility,
self-hosted chat experiments, protocol research, and long-running work toward a
practical community server.

The protocol stack is built on the published
[`github.com/iamxvbaba/td`](https://github.com/iamxvbaba/td) module
(`v1.1.0`), using a canonical Layer 228 schema with sparse `tlprofile`
exact Layer 225-228 compatibility profiles.

This project is based on [`iamxvbaba/gramsrv`](https://github.com/iamxvbaba/gramsrv).
The `Flashgram-OSS/gramsrv` repository preserves that upstream attribution and
contains the organization-specific changes and integrations maintained here.

If you are looking for a **Telegram server**, **MTProto server**,
**Telegram backend**, **Telegram clone server**, or **self-hosted
Telegram-like chat server**, this repository is the server-side implementation
to study, run, and improve.

`gramsrv` is independent and unofficial. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
or sponsored by Telegram or the official Telegram team.

## Client Ecosystem

`gramsrv` is the server side of the stack, and client projects make self-hosted
Telegram-compatible networks much easier to try in real life.

We are happy to highlight [OwpenGram](https://owpengram.org/), a multi-server
Telegram-style client project for using the official network, private
self-hosted servers, and community nodes from one client experience. OwpenGram
includes built-in compatibility for `gramsrv` servers, and we recommend
checking it out if you want a client focused on switching between multiple
Telegram-compatible servers.

Some items are compatibility-first or experimental, but they are real open
server code, not hidden product-only features. The next step is making these
paths stronger together.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Go 1.25 or newer
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose
- OpenSSL, if you want to build a matching Telegram Desktop client

Start PostgreSQL and Redis:

```powershell
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build and run the single server program:

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
go build -o bin/gramsrv.exe ./cmd/telesrv
.\bin\gramsrv.exe
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
go build -o bin/gramsrv ./cmd/telesrv
./bin/gramsrv
```

On first start, `gramsrv` creates `data/server_rsa.pem`, applies database
migrations, seeds bundled language packs, prepares optional media resources,
starts MTProto on `0.0.0.0:2398`, and brings up the update/media/background
workers in the same process.

Useful local environment variables:

See the complete [English configuration reference](docs/configuration.en.md) or

## Public Deployment Ports

When deploying `gramsrv` on a public server, open the following ports according
to the features you enable.

### Minimal public deployment (chat only)

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2398 | TCP | MTProto main port; also handles WebSocket when `TELESRV_WEBSOCKET_ENABLE=true` | Yes |

### With Admin backend

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2399 | TCP | Admin REST API | Restrict to trusted IPs or put behind VPN |
| 2600 | TCP | Admin Web UI | Use Nginx/reverse proxy + HTTPS in production |

### Optional feature ports

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | When needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2400 | TCP | RTMP live stream ingest | Live streaming |
| 12399 | UDP | SFU/WebRTC conferencing | Voice/video group calls |
| 12400 | UDP | TURN/STUN server | P2P/call relay |
| 12500-12999 | UDP | TURN relay port range | TURN relay |
| configurable | TCP | Bot API | When `TELESRV_BOT_API_ADDR` is set |
| 2401 example | TCP | Public username/sticker/chatlist landing pages | When `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR=127.0.0.1:2401` is set |

### Internal/debug ports (do not expose publicly)

| Port | Default bind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 6060 | `127.0.0.1:6060` | pprof debugging endpoint |
| 5432 | `127.0.0.1:5432` | PostgreSQL |
| 6399 | `127.0.0.1:6399` | Redis |

Make sure `TELESRV_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:2398` is set, and `TELESRV_ADVERTISE_IP`
points to your public IP so clients can connect.

## Public Link Landing Pages

`gramsrv` can serve public landing pages for `/<username>`, profile avatars,
`/addstickers/<shortName>`, `/addemoji/<shortName>`, and `/addlist/<slug>`.
The same listener also serves the self-hosted Telegram-style `/botfather` and
`/stickers` mini-app shells. Their browser API is under `/api/miniapps/*` and
does not call Telegram or a Telegram CDN; BotFather token validation is a
format-only local stub until an authenticated provider is configured.

Use `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR` as the local HTTP bind address:

```env
TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR=127.0.0.1:2401
```

Use `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` as the external canonical URL shown in generated
links:

```env
TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.example
TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME=yourapp
TELESRV_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE_URL=https://web.your-domain.example
TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=YourApp
```

In production, keep `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR` on loopback and reverse-proxy
the public routes to it with HTTPS.

## Client Compatibility

Stock Telegram clients will not connect to `gramsrv` because they trust
Telegram's production DC list and RSA keys. Use a patched experience client from
the [official website](https://telesrv.net), or build your own client with a
minimal protocol patch.

Current Telegram Desktop baseline:

- Telegram Desktop commit: `9caf32dffc90ddd9bb08ad5777b865f729fa167b`
- Canonical TL layer: 228
- Exact compatibility profiles: Layer 225-228
- Local DC: `127.0.0.1:2398`, DC id `2`

After `gramsrv` generates `data/server_rsa.pem`, export the matching public key:

```powershell
openssl rsa -in data/server_rsa.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out data/server_rsa.pub
```

Patch `Telegram/SourceFiles/mtproto/mtproto_dc_options.cpp`:

1. Replace the built-in production/test DC lists with your `gramsrv` endpoint.
2. Replace both `kPublicRSAKeys` and `kTestPublicRSAKeys` with
   `data/server_rsa.pub`.
3. Add `Flag::f_tcpo_only` to the built-in DC flags.

Keep the client patch minimal: endpoint, RSA key, and TCP-only flags only.

## Multi-Device Smoke Test

Use separate client working directories so sessions do not share local `tdata`:

```powershell
$tdesktop = "C:\path\to\tdesktop\out\Debug\Telegram.exe"
Start-Process $tdesktop -ArgumentList @("-workdir", "$PWD\.tdata-alice")
Start-Process $tdesktop -ArgumentList @("-workdir", "$PWD\.tdata-bob")
```

Log in with different phone numbers. In local development, the login code is
`12345` unless you changed `TELESRV_DEV_AUTH_CODE`.

Recommended checks:

- Send private messages, stickers, media, replies, forwards, edits, deletes,
  and read receipts between two users.
- Keep one device online and restart another device to verify offline
  `updates.getDifference` recovery.
- Open the same account from multiple sessions and confirm current-session
  echoes are not duplicated while other online sessions receive updates.
- Check server logs for no new `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `Unhandled RPC`, `bad_msg`,
  panic, or internal errors.

## TODO List

- Improve Bot compatibility for third-party libraries, such as `python-telegram-bot`.
- Fix known bugs and keep hardening existing compatibility paths.

## Help Improve It

`gramsrv` will get better fastest if more people run it, break it, profile it,
and send focused improvements. Helpful contributions include:

- Telegram Desktop and Android compatibility reports with reproducible steps.
- RPC traces for startup, sync, chat, media, calls, bots, or edge cases.
- Focused fixes for implemented paths instead of broad rewrites.
- Tests for online/offline updates, multi-device sessions, read state, media,
  and channel behavior.
- Performance work on hot paths such as fan-out, pagination, storage queries,
  media upload/download, and connection handling.
- Setup improvements that make the one-program local experience smoother.

If a change affects visible client behavior, please include the client
version/commit, the RPC path you tested, and whether server logs stayed free of
new `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, `Unhandled RPC`, `bad_msg`, panic, or internal errors.

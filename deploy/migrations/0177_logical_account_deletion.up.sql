-- Human account deletion is a logical user tombstone.  The deleted user keeps
-- all relationship/history rows, so the users UPDATE must not fan out through
-- every reverse contact, dialog and channel membership.  A dedicated event
-- invalidates the base-user and RPC projection caches as one coarse boundary.

-- Collectible phone ownership is an account asset, not the editable users.phone
-- identity field.  Logical deletion preserves it; physical user deletion keeps
-- the separate 0171 release trigger.

# telesrv configuration reference

Chinese version: [configuration.zh-CN.md](configuration.zh-CN.md)

This document describes every setting loaded by `internal/config`. Defaults and validation behavior in `internal/config/config.go` are authoritative. All settings require a process restart; telesrv does not hot-reload configuration.

## 1. Loading, syntax, and precedence

- `TELESRV_CONFIG` is a **process environment variable** selecting the env-style configuration file. Default: `.env` in the process working directory. An explicit empty value disables file loading. Setting it inside the file has no effect because the file has already been selected.
- Precedence is: non-empty process environment value → non-empty file value → code default. The nullable listener settings (`TELESRV_DEBUG_ADDR`, `TELESRV_BOT_API_ADDR`, `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_ADDR`, and `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR`) additionally allow an explicitly empty process value to disable a non-empty file value.
- The file accepts blank lines, full-line `#` comments, optional `export `, and `KEY=VALUE`. Single- and double-quoted values are supported. Inline comments are not stripped.
- File keys must start with `TELESRV_` and contain only uppercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores. Unknown `TELESRV_*` keys are syntactically accepted but ignored by the current binary.
- Booleans accept `1/true/TRUE/True/yes/on` and `0/false/FALSE/False/no/off`. Lists are comma-separated. Durations use Go duration syntax such as `200ms`, `30s`, `5m`, or `168h`.
- Invalid integer, float, boolean, or duration text falls back to the code default. URL, app-scheme, app-name, and login-email dependency validation fails startup instead.
- Never commit real passwords, tokens, private DSNs, or TURN secrets. Prefer a secret manager or protected service environment in production.

## 2. MTProto listener, transport, and resource budgets

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_LISTEN` | string / `0.0.0.0:2398` | MTProto TCP listen address. Must match the address/port reachable by patched clients. |
| `TELESRV_ADVERTISE_IP` | string / `127.0.0.1` | Client-reachable server IP written to `help.getConfig.DCOptions` and used by media/call fallbacks. The loopback default is only safe for pure local TDesktop validation; Android, LAN, and remote validation must set the host LAN/public IP explicitly. On Windows, prefer `scripts\restart-local-server.ps1 -Listen 0.0.0.0:2398 -AdvertiseIP <client-reachable-ip>` so a manual `Start-Process` launch cannot drop the environment. |
| `TELESRV_RSA_KEY` | path / `data/server_rsa.pem` | MTProto RSA private key. Generated when missing. Treat the file as a secret and keep it stable across restarts. |
| `TELESRV_DC` | positive TL int32 / `2` | Canonical server DC ID used in server-originated configuration, media/DC metadata, and `channelFull.stats_dc`. It must be within `1..2147483647` or startup fails. It does not partition key-exchange state on the current single backend. |
| `TELESRV_DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE` | ISO alpha-2 / `CN` | Country returned by `help.getNearestDc` for login-page preselection. Clients map `CN` to calling code `+86`, `US` to `+1`, and so on. Input is trimmed, uppercased, and validated as a country or autonomous area; malformed or unknown values fail startup. |
| `TELESRV_STRICT_DC_CHECK` | bool / `false` | Default `false` accepts every wire int32 DC label for permanent and temporary key exchange. `true` requires permanent `dc_id == TELESRV_DC` and temporary `abs(dc_id) == TELESRV_DC`; it is only a diagnostic and does not provide multi-DC isolation. |
| `TELESRV_WEBSOCKET_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables MTProto-over-WebSocket demultiplexing on the MTProto listener. |
| `TELESRV_WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | list / `http://localhost:1234,http://127.0.0.1:1234` | Browser WebSocket origin allow-list. `*` is for temporary debugging only. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | int / `200000` | Global physical connection admission limit. Negative disables this gate. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP` | int / `4096` | Per-source-IP physical connection limit. Negative disables this gate. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_MAX_CONCURRENT_HANDSHAKES` | int / `256` | Concurrent expensive RSA/DH handshakes. Negative disables this gate. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_MAX_INFLIGHT` | int / `32` | Per-connection concurrent RPC budget; non-positive values are normalized by the edge to its safe default. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_QUEUE_SIZE` | int / `64` | Per-connection queued RPC budget; non-positive values use the edge default. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_TIMEOUT` | duration / `30s` | End-to-end handler timeout for scheduled RPC work. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_GLOBAL_WORKERS` | int / `256` | Shared fair-scheduler worker count. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_GLOBAL_MAX_TASKS` | int / `8192` | Process-wide scheduled/in-flight RPC task cap. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_GLOBAL_MAX_BYTES` | int64 charge bytes / `536870912` | Process-wide reserved/queued/in-flight RPC memory charge. Exact admission reserves a conservative typed-materialization charge from wire size and grows it atomically before a nested-gzip-expanded graph is decoded; grow failure rejects the complete candidate batch. This is not an equal amount of concurrently receivable wire bytes. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_EXECUTION_MAX_ENTRIES` | int / `262144` | Global cap for pending owners and compact unacknowledged execution receipts. Receipts retain request identity, execution outcome, and Layer admission metadata only—never TL bodies. `msgs_ack` removes them immediately; 331 seconds is only the no-ACK safety horizon. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_EXECUTION_AUTH_MAX_ENTRIES` | int / `32768` | Per-raw-auth owner/receipt cap; limits satisfy `global >= auth >= session`. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_EXECUTION_SESSION_MAX_ENTRIES` | int / `16384` | Per `raw auth key + session_id` owner/receipt cap. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_RPC_EXECUTION_PENDING_PER_AUTH` | int / `2048` | Additional active-owner cap per raw auth key; no greater than global pending tasks or auth entries. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_INBOUND_FRAME_GLOBAL_MAX_BYTES` | int64 bytes / `536870912` | Process-wide reservation for transport wire bytes, maximum decrypted plaintext, and every live outer/nested gzip expansion, acquired before the corresponding payload allocation. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_OUTBOUND_QUEUE_SIZE` | int / `128` | Per-connection normal outbound mailbox capacity. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_OUTBOUND_CONTROL_QUEUE_SIZE` | int / `32` | Per-connection control-message mailbox capacity. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_OUTBOUND_TRACKED_GLOBAL_MAX_BYTES` | int64 bytes / `536870912` | Sole global budget for unacknowledged logical-session bodies. Reconnects reuse the same `msg_id/seq_no/body`; ACK, destroy, or six minutes offline releases it, with no second RPC cache/spool copy. |
| `TELESRV_MTPROTO_OUTBOUND_WRITE_GLOBAL_MAX_BYTES` | int64 bytes / `536870912` | Global budget for concurrent encrypted wire/codec/obfuscation scratch. |

Nested gzip admission adds no environment setting. Code-enforced ceilings are
10 MiB of output per `gzip_packed` envelope and 32 MiB of cumulative expansion
work per transport frame across outer, nested, sibling, failed, and
authoritative-profile re-decode attempts. Releasing a live expanded buffer
returns process memory but does not refund that frame's CPU/work counter.
Retained typed graphs remain charged to the RPC scheduler budget above.

## 3. HTTP endpoints, public links, and administration

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_DEBUG_ADDR` | nullable address / `127.0.0.1:6060` | pprof/debug listener. Empty disables it. Keep loopback-only; use an SSH tunnel for production profiling. |
| `TELESRV_BOT_API_ADDR` | nullable address / empty | Minimal HTTP Bot API listener. Empty disables it. It shares MTProto app/store facts. `setWebhook` accepts any valid `http://` or `https://` host/IP and port in `1..65535`. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_ADDR` | nullable address / empty | In-process Admin write API listener. Empty disables it; production should bind loopback. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` | secret string / empty | Admin API bearer token. Required when the Admin API is enabled and must match the Admin UI token configuration. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_ADDR` | address / `127.0.0.1:2600` | Standalone `cmd/telesrv-admin` listen address. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PASSWORD` | secret string / empty | Admin UI login password. Configure this or `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_TOKEN`. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_TOKEN` | secret string / empty | Alternative Admin UI login credential. Admin write calls still use the separate `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_TOKEN`. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_SESSION_KEY` | secret string / empty | Encrypts/signs Admin UI session cookies. Production should use at least 32 random bytes; changing it invalidates sessions. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PERMISSIONS` | comma-separated list / `*` | Permissions granted to an Admin UI session authenticated with `TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PASSWORD` / `_TOKEN`. `*` grants every permission and is the default. Reading a managed bot token requires the explicit `bots.token.read` permission; the token is returned only by the command response and is not persisted in the audit result. Names use letters, digits and `._:-`, at most 64 characters, and may end in `namespace.*` to grant a whole namespace. An empty list or an unparsable name fails startup. |
| `TELESRV_ADMIN_SCOPED_TOKENS` | `name:token:perm1,perm2` entries separated by `;` / empty | Additional Admin API bearer tokens carrying a bounded permission set each, so an integration gets exactly the rights it needs instead of the unrestricted `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_TOKEN`. A token may contain neither `:` nor whitespace, every entry must list at least one permission, names and tokens must be unique, and reusing `TELESRV_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` as a scoped token is refused because it would silently widen it to every permission. Any malformed entry fails startup rather than silently granting or dropping rights. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | HTTP(S) URL / `https://telesrv.net` | Client-visible canonical public-link root. Paths are allowed; credentials, query, and fragment are rejected. Local example: `http://127.0.0.1:2401`. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_PRODUCT_NAME` | string / `Telesrv` | Parent product display name shared by the system account, login notices, invites, WebAuthn, built-in bots, and upstream visible-copy rewriting. Trimmed, non-empty, no control characters, at most 64 Unicode characters. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_PRODUCT_USERNAME` | username / `telesrv` | Public username of system account 777000. It is trimmed, loses an optional leading `@`, is normalized to lowercase, and must be a 5–32 character ASCII username starting with a letter. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_DESKTOP_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Desktop` | Desktop/Windows name returned by `account.getAuthorizations`; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_ANDROID_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Android` | Android name shown in authorization lists; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_IOS_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv iOS` | iOS name shown in authorization lists; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_MACOS_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv macOS` | macOS name shown in authorization lists; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_WEB_A_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Web A` | Authorization-list name for `telegram-tt` / `weba`; durable detection tokens remain unchanged. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_WEB_K_APP_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Web K` | Authorization-list name for `tweb` / `webk`; durable detection tokens remain unchanged. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_PREMIUM_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Premium` | Product name used by Premium status and related client-visible copy; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_BRAND_STARS_NAME` | string / `Telesrv Stars` | Product name used by Stars payment labels and related client-visible copy; same validation as the product name. |
| `TELESRV_UPDATE_PUBLIC_URL` | nullable HTTP(S) URL / empty | Client-visible root of `cmd/telesrv-update`; advertised through `help.getConfig.autoupdate_url_prefix`. Empty disables native desktop updates. See `docs/update-service.md`. |
| `TELESRV_UPDATE_SERVICE_URL` | nullable HTTP(S) URL / `TELESRV_UPDATE_PUBLIC_URL` | Internal update resolver used for `help.getAppUpdate`. It may be a loopback/private route; empty falls back to the public update URL. |
| `TELESRV_UPDATE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | duration / `2s` | Deadline for an application-update resolve call; must be greater than zero and at most `30s`. Resolver failure returns `help.noAppUpdate`, not an RPC 500. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME` | URL scheme / `telesrv` | Automatic app-open scheme on landing pages. Must match patched client registration. `tg`, `http`, and `https` are rejected. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_LINK_BASE` | nullable custom URL base / empty | Optional host-based root for multi-server clients, for example `owpg://example.com`. When set, links use `owpg://example.com/oauth`, `owpg://example.com/<username>`, and equivalent route paths. Only exact `<custom-scheme>://<host>` values are accepted; ports, paths, queries, and fragments are rejected. `TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME` remains an accepted legacy input. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_WEB_BASE_URL` | HTTP(S) URL / `https://weba.telesrv.net` | Web-client root used by public username pages. Same URL validation as `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` | string / `TELESRV_BRAND_PRODUCT_NAME` | Public landing-page product name; trimmed, non-empty, no control characters, maximum 64 Unicode characters. |
| `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR` | nullable address / empty | Username/avatar/sticker/emoji/chatlist/collectible-gift landing pages plus the hash-only moderation appeal form. Empty disables it. Production should bind loopback behind exact nginx routes. Moderation `freeze_account` actions fail closed when this listener is disabled because telesrv cannot issue a reachable appeal URL. `.env.example` enables `127.0.0.1:2401` for development. |
| `TELESRV_MINIAPP_BOTFATHER_TOKEN` | `<93372553>:<35-char-secret>` / empty | Server-only token secret used to sign and verify the local BotFather Mini App. When set, it is written to the built-in BotFather row before RPC/Web services start; it is never rendered in HTML or returned by list APIs. |
| `TELESRV_MINIAPP_STICKERS_TOKEN` | `<1063110917>:<35-char-secret>` / empty | Server-only token secret used to sign and verify the local Stickers Mini App. A 35-character secret is required for state-changing requests; empty keeps the app unavailable rather than accepting forgeable init data. |
| `TELESRV_CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_ENABLE` | bool / `false` | Enable the self-hosted TON mainnet gift withdrawal flow and its CustomFragment routes. Requires the public Web listener and a configured collection/signing key. |
| `TELESRV_CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | HTTP(S) URL / `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Canonical external root for CustomFragment metadata, PNG posters, raw `.lottie.json`, and withdrawal URLs. Use a dedicated HTTPS host when native clients would otherwise classify the path as an internal app link. |
| `TELESRV_CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` | path / `data/customfragment/mint-authority.key` | Ed25519 mint-authority key; keep it outside version control and stable across restarts. |
| `TELESRV_CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_GIFT_COLLECTION` | TON basechain address / empty | Mainnet CustomFragment collection address. Required when the feature is enabled. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ENABLE` | bool / `false` | Mount the self-hosted Telegram Login/OIDC provider on `TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR`. Enabling it requires that listener and all key files below. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ISSUER` | absolute origin URL / `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Exact public issuer used in discovery and tokens. HTTPS is required by default; paths, credentials, query, and fragment are rejected. The next setting permits any HTTP host/IP. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ALLOW_HTTP` | bool / `false` | When enabled, permits any valid HTTP issuer, BotFather Web origin, redirect URI, and native HTTP callback, without loopback, subnet, or port restrictions. When disabled, those Web URLs still require HTTPS. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SIGNING_KEYS_FILE` | path / `data/telegram-login/signing-keys.json` | JOSE private-key ring generated by `cmd/telegramloginkeygen`; active plus retiring public keys are published through JWKS. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_CODE_KEYS_FILE` | path / `data/telegram-login/code-keys.json` | AES-256-GCM envelope-key ring for recoverable, one-time authorization codes. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SECRET_PEPPER_FILE` | path / `data/telegram-login/client-secret-pepper` | Deployment pepper for HMAC-SHA-256 client-secret hashes. The file must contain a base64 encoding of exactly 32 random bytes. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_REQUEST_TTL` | duration / `5m` | Pending authorization lifetime; bounded to `1m..15m`. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_CODE_TTL` | duration / `2m` | One-time code lifetime; bounded to `30s..10m`. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ID_TOKEN_TTL` | duration / `1h` | Signed ID-token lifetime; bounded to `1m..24h`. Retiring signing keys must cover this window. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | comma-separated CIDRs / empty | Only requests whose direct peer is in this list may supply `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-*` client metadata. The documented nginx deployment uses `127.0.0.1/32,::1/128`. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_RETENTION` | duration / `168h` | Retention after terminal request/code/revocation state; bounded to `1h..90d`. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | duration / `5m` | Retention worker interval; bounded to `10s..1h`. |
| `TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SWEEP_BATCH` | int / `500` | Maximum rows per retention pass; bounded to `1..1000`. |

### 3.1 Bot API webhook troubleshooting

Start by separating the three addresses below. Never use the webhook receiver domain as the Bot
API endpoint unless an explicit reverse-proxy route maps that domain to telesrv:

| Name | Setting/source | Direction and purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Bot API listener | telesrv `TELESRV_BOT_API_ADDR` | The telesrv bind address; empty disables the gateway. `0.0.0.0` is valid only for binding and is not a client request target. |
| Bot API base URL | the bot application's `TELEGRAM_API_URL` or equivalent | A client-reachable address for telesrv, for example `http://172.17.0.1:8088`. Method URLs are `<base>/bot<TOKEN>/<method>` and file URLs are `<base>/file/bot<TOKEN>/<file_path>`. |
| Webhook receiver URL | the bot application's `WEBHOOK_URL + WEBHOOK_PATH`, registered by `setWebhook` | The target to which telesrv actively POSTs updates, for example `https://bot.example.com/webhook`. It is not the Bot API base URL. |

The network direction is different too: polling is `bot application -> telesrv Bot API`, while
webhook delivery is `telesrv -> bot application webhook receiver`. Working polling proves only the
first path. It does not prove webhook DNS, outbound TCP, TLS, reverse proxy, or Docker hairpin
connectivity.

#### 1. Query the authoritative webhook state from the Bot API

Run this inside the bot application container with its actual Bot API base URL. Do not expand and
paste the token into chat, tickets, or screenshots:

```sh
curl -sS -X POST \
  "${TELEGRAM_API_URL%/}/bot${BOT_TOKEN}/getWebhookInfo" | jq
```

If the application uses a differently named variable, replace `TELEGRAM_API_URL` with the
**client-reachable address** corresponding to `TELESRV_BOT_API_ADDR`. For example, if telesrv binds
`0.0.0.0:8088`, a container on the same host might use `http://172.17.0.1:8088`; it must not request
`http://0.0.0.0:8088`.

Interpret the result as follows:

| Result | Conclusion and next step |
|---|---|
| Empty `url` | No webhook is registered on this telesrv instance. Verify that the application uses this Bot API base URL and that startup `setWebhook` succeeded. |
| Increasing `pending_update_count` | Updates reached the telesrv durable queue but are not being delivered successfully. Inspect `last_error_message`. |
| HTTP `401`/`403` in `last_error_message` | The receiver is reachable, but its webhook secret differs or an authentication layer rejected the request. |
| `dial tcp ... i/o timeout` | telesrv cannot connect to the target IP/port. Check outbound firewall rules, Docker networking, loopback/hairpin NAT, and security groups. |
| `connection refused` | The address is reachable, but nothing listens on that port or the port mapping/reverse-proxy upstream is wrong. |
| DNS/`no such host` | The webhook hostname cannot be resolved from the telesrv runtime environment. |
| TLS/`x509` error | The certificate chain, hostname, SNI, or container CA trust is wrong. HTTPS uses the system trust store. |
| Target type absent from `allowed_updates` | Newly produced updates of that type are not queued. A normal `/start` requires at least `message`. |
| Pending reaches zero but the app does not react | telesrv received a 2xx response. Inspect the receiver's internal queue, workers, dispatcher, and handlers. |

`getWebhookInfo` reports telesrv's persisted delivery facts. An application `/health` endpoint only
proves that its receiver route and workers started; it cannot replace this check.

#### 2. Validate the receiver with the correct header

The Telegram webhook secret is distinct from the Bot token, OIDC Client Secret, and other API
keys. The receiver validates `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`, not `Authorization: Bearer`:

```sh
curl -i -X POST "${WEBHOOK_URL%/}${WEBHOOK_PATH}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token: ${WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"update_id":2147483000}'
```

Expect an HTTP 2xx response. `401 invalid_secret_token` proves that the request reached the
application but the header was absent or did not match. Recreate/restart the application after
editing `.env`; changing the file alone neither updates the secret already registered in telesrv
nor the receiver process's startup-time secret.

#### 3. Test from the actual telesrv network namespace

A browser or official Telegram reaching the public webhook proves only public inbound
connectivity. Repeat the test from the host, container, or network namespace that actually runs
telesrv:

```sh
docker exec <telesrv-container> sh -lc \
  'getent hosts bot.example.com; curl -vk --connect-timeout 10 https://bot.example.com/health/unified'
```

If public clients work but this returns `dial tcp ...:443: i/o timeout`, a same-host public-IP
hairpin failure is a common cause. Prefer split DNS or a container host mapping so the public
hostname resolves to the reverse proxy's internal entry point inside the telesrv container while
preserving the hostname, HTTPS SNI, and certificate validation. If the reverse proxy publishes
443 on the Docker host, test first with:

```sh
curl -vk --resolve bot.example.com:443:172.17.0.1 \
  https://bot.example.com/health/unified
```

After that succeeds, a deployment may use a network-appropriate Compose entry such as:

```yaml
extra_hosts:
  - "bot.example.com:host-gateway"
```

Other fixes include attaching telesrv to the reverse proxy's Docker network, allowing the Docker
subnet to reach host port 443, or correcting cloud security-group/NAT hairpin rules. telesrv allows
an internal HTTP receiver, but use one only on a controlled shared network and only when the
application's `WEBHOOK_URL` is not also its public OIDC, payment, or media callback base. Do not
blindly replace a global public URL with an internal address to mask a routing problem.

#### 4. Close the loop after the fix

1. Restart the bot application so it calls `setWebhook` again with the current URL, secret, and
   `allowed_updates`.
2. Send a new `/start` or press a callback button.
3. Call `getWebhookInfo` again. `pending_update_count` should fall to `0`, with no new
   `last_error_date`.
4. Inspect telesrv Warning logs for `bot api webhook delivery failed`. The record contains
   `bot_user_id`, `retry_in`, and the failure reason, but must not contain the webhook URL, Bot
   token, or secret.
5. Confirm that the receiver recorded and processed the `update_id`. Delivery is at-least-once, so
   the application must safely handle duplicate updates caused by retries.

Immediately rotate any Bot token, webhook secret, OIDC Client Secret, API key, or database
password exposed in shell history, chat, or screenshots. Keep only redacted diagnostics in support
material.

### 3.2 Complete Telegram Login / OIDC setup

#### 1. Generate `data/telegram-login` once

Run this from the `telesrv` repository root:

```powershell
go run ./cmd/telegramloginkeygen -mode init -dir data/telegram-login
Get-ChildItem .\data\telegram-login
```

The same command works on Linux; restrict the generated directory afterward:

```bash
go run ./cmd/telegramloginkeygen -mode init -dir data/telegram-login
chmod 0700 data/telegram-login
chmod 0600 data/telegram-login/*
```

Initialization creates the following private files. It never prints key material and refuses to
overwrite an existing `signing-keys.json`, `code-keys.json`, or `client-secret-pepper`:

- `signing-keys.json` plus three `signing-*.pem` files: the manifest and private keys for RS256,
  ES256, and EdDSA ID-token signatures;
- `code-keys.json`: the AES-256-GCM envelope-key ring for one-time authorization codes;
- `client-secret-pepper`: a 32-byte deployment pepper used to store and verify OIDC Client Secret
  digests.

The repository ignores `data/*` by default. Never put this directory in Git, release archives,
logs, or ordinary backups. All instances must mount the same protected files and restart together
after rotation. Losing the pepper invalidates existing Client Secret verification. Losing a signing
key that is still in its publication window invalidates otherwise-live ID tokens against JWKS.

#### 2. Configure and start the Provider

This example exposes OIDC directly at `http://192.0.2.25:2401`; replace it with the server address
that clients can actually reach. Bind `0.0.0.0:2401` for direct LAN/public access, or keep
`127.0.0.1:2401` when an on-host reverse proxy is the only caller:

```env
TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://192.0.2.25:2401
TELESRV_PUBLIC_LINK_WEB_ADDR=0.0.0.0:2401
TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME=telesrv
# Optional for multi-server clients: TELESRV_PUBLIC_APP_LINK_BASE=owpg://example.com

TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ENABLE=true
TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ISSUER=http://192.0.2.25:2401
TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ALLOW_HTTP=true
TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SIGNING_KEYS_FILE=data/telegram-login/signing-keys.json
TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_CODE_KEYS_FILE=data/telegram-login/code-keys.json
TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_SECRET_PEPPER_FILE=data/telegram-login/client-secret-pepper
```

For HTTPS, set the issuer and public base to the exact HTTPS origin and leave
`TELESRV_TELEGRAM_LOGIN_ALLOW_HTTP=false`. The issuer becomes the token `iss` and the root of all
discovery endpoints, so its scheme, host, and port must exactly match the address used by relying
parties. Start or restart `telesrv`, then verify the public endpoints:

```powershell
curl.exe http://192.0.2.25:2401/.well-known/openid-configuration
curl.exe http://192.0.2.25:2401/.well-known/jwks.json
curl.exe -I http://192.0.2.25:2401/js/telegram-login.js
```

The discovery `issuer` must equal the configured value, and its `authorization_endpoint`,
`token_endpoint`, and `jwks_uri` must be reachable by the relying party. A reverse proxy must pass
through `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, `/.well-known/jwks.json`, `/auth`, `/auth/status`,
`/token`, `/crossapp`, `/inapp`, `/telegram-login.js`, and `/js/telegram-login.js` unchanged.

#### 3. Create an OIDC Client with the local `@BotFather`

Create a bot with `/newbot` or select an existing bot. In the local `@BotFather`, run `/setlogin`
and choose that bot. Initial setup returns:

- `Client ID`: the bot user ID as a decimal string;
- `Client Secret`: shown once, separate from the Bot API token, and meant to be saved immediately
  in a secret manager.

After selecting a bot once, BotFather keeps that configuration session active; there is no need to
repeat `/setlogin` and the bot username for every change. Send commands one at a time or paste them
as separate lines in one message (up to 32 lines per message). This example runs the relying party
at `http://192.0.2.30:3000`:

```text
add origin http://192.0.2.30:3000
add redirect http://192.0.2.30:3000/oauth/callback
algorithm RS256
enable
```

Send `/done` after the changes succeed. BotFather closes the session and returns the final
configuration summary. Every successful change takes effect immediately, so `/cancel` only closes
the session and does not roll back changes. If a multi-line message fails partway through,
BotFather identifies the applied lines, the failed line, and the later lines that were skipped,
then keeps the selected bot active for a corrected command.

An `origin` is an exact Web origin without a path, query, or fragment; it authorizes the JS SDK,
popup CORS, and legacy `login_url`. A `redirect` is the exact full URI that receives an
Authorization Code. Wildcards and prefix matching are not supported. Use `/logininfo` to inspect
status and registrations; use `/setlogin` to add/remove URLs, change the algorithm, or disable the
client; use `/resetloginsecret` to rotate the Client Secret. Available algorithms are RS256,
ES256, EdDSA, and ES256K only when its build/key ring is present. EdDSA and ES256K accept only the
`openid` scope.

#### 4. Integrate a relying party with standard OIDC

Start by loading:

```text
http://192.0.2.25:2401/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The standard flow is Authorization Code with PKCE S256:

1. Generate random `state`, `nonce`, and PKCE `code_verifier`; derive the S256 `code_challenge`.
2. Open the discovery `authorization_endpoint` with `client_id`, the exact `redirect_uri`,
   `response_type=code`, a `scope` containing `openid`, `state`, `nonce`, `code_challenge`, and
   `code_challenge_method=S256`.
3. After the user approves in TDesktop/Android, verify `state` at the relying-party callback and
   read the one-time code.
4. Server-side, POST `grant_type=authorization_code`, the code, the same `redirect_uri`, and
   `code_verifier` to the discovery `token_endpoint`. Confidential clients authenticate with HTTP
   Basic or `client_secret_post`.
5. Verify the ID-token signature with the discovery `jwks_uri`, then strictly validate `iss`,
   `aud`, `exp`, `nonce`, and a non-empty `sub`. Decoding without signature verification is not
   sufficient.

Supported scopes are `openid`, `profile`, `phone`, and `telegram:bot_access`. The provider does not
currently expose UserInfo, refresh tokens, or an introspection endpoint. Browser applications may
load `<issuer>/js/telegram-login.js` for the local JS SDK. A Client Secret must remain server-side.

#### 5. Verify the complete path with the Bedolaga demo

Install the demo dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv "$env:TEMP\telesrv-bedolaga-demo-venv"
& "$env:TEMP\telesrv-bedolaga-demo-venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install `
  -r .\cmd\bots\bedolagaformat\requirements.txt
```

Put the Client ID/Secret from step 3 and the same bot's Bot API token only in process environment:

```powershell
$env:TELESRV_BOT_TOKEN = "<bot_id>:<bot_api_secret>"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_API_SERVER = "http://192.0.2.25:8081"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_DEMO = "1"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_ISSUER = "http://192.0.2.25:2401"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID = "<Client ID returned by BotFather>"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET = "<one-time OIDC Client Secret>"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_PUBLIC_URL = "http://192.0.2.30:3000"
$env:TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_LISTEN = "0.0.0.0:3000"

& "$env:TEMP\telesrv-bedolaga-demo-venv\Scripts\python.exe" `
  .\cmd\bots\bedolagaformat\demo.py --drop-pending --login-demo
```

The BotFather origin must equal `TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_PUBLIC_URL`, and the redirect must equal
`<TELESRV_BOT_LOGIN_PUBLIC_URL>/oauth/callback`. Send `/logindemo` to the bot. The first button
tests Bot API `login_url` plus the HMAC callback; the second page tests the local JS SDK popup and
Authorization Code + PKCE/JWKS. Omitting the Client Secret leaves JS popup verification available
but explicitly disables the server-side code flow.

#### 6. Rotate keys

When rotating a signing key, retain the old public key for at least the configured ID-token TTL
plus ten minutes. Restart all instances together after the operation:

```powershell
go run ./cmd/telegramloginkeygen -mode rotate-signing -algorithm RS256 `
  -id-token-ttl 1h -publish-for 2h -dir data/telegram-login
go run ./cmd/telegramloginkeygen -mode rotate-code -dir data/telegram-login
```

Run `rotate-signing` separately for RS256, ES256, or EdDSA. `rotate-code` retains old code keys and
adds a new active key. Do not edit manifests or PEM files manually, and never generate divergent
key rings independently on different instances.

## 4. PostgreSQL, Redis, files, and seed data

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_POSTGRES_DSN` | secret DSN / `postgres://telesrv:telesrv@127.0.0.1:5432/telesrv?sslmode=disable` | Primary durable business database. Production must replace the development credentials and TLS policy. |
| `TELESRV_POSTGRES_MAX_CONNS` | int / `50` | pgxpool maximum connections. `<=0` delegates to pgx defaults, which are usually too small for production outbox/RPC concurrency. |
| `TELESRV_POSTGRES_MIN_CONNS` | int / `16` | pgxpool pre-warmed minimum connections. |
| `TELESRV_REDIS_ADDR` | address / `127.0.0.1:6399` | Redis used for volatile codes, limits, and shared update/cache state. |
| `TELESRV_REDIS_PASSWORD` | secret string / empty | Redis password. |
| `TELESRV_REDIS_DB` | int / `0` | Redis logical database number. |
| `TELESRV_LANGPACK_SEED_DIR` | path / `data/langpack` | TDesktop `.strings` language-pack seed directory. |
| `TELESRV_OFFICIAL_GIFTS_DIR` | path / `data/official-gifts` | Read-only snapshot generated by `cmd/giftfetch`, used for verified explicit imports in the admin UI. |
| `TELESRV_BLOB_BACKEND` | enum / `localfs` | The only permanent media backend: `localfs` or `s3`. There is no cross-backend fallback, dual read, or dual write; startup rejects rows for another backend. |
| `TELESRV_BLOB_DIR` | path / `data/blobs` | Permanent media and transient upload parts for `localfs`; S3 mode never falls back to this directory. |
| `TELESRV_BLOB_STAGING_DIR` | path / `data/blob-staging` | Local transient upload parts and write spool in `s3` mode; not a permanent backend. |
| `TELESRV_S3_ENDPOINT` | host[:port] / empty | Required in `s3` mode, without an `http://` or `https://` scheme. |
| `TELESRV_S3_REGION` | string / `us-east-1` | S3 region. |
| `TELESRV_S3_BUCKET` | string / empty | Required permanent-media bucket in `s3` mode. |
| `TELESRV_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | secret / empty | Required in `s3` mode; no weak shipped credential. |
| `TELESRV_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | secret / empty | Required in `s3` mode and never logged. |
| `TELESRV_S3_USE_SSL` | bool / `true` | Use TLS for the S3 endpoint. |
| `TELESRV_S3_PATH_STYLE` | bool / `false` | Force path-style bucket lookup; commonly `true` for local MinIO. |
| `TELESRV_S3_CREATE_BUCKET` | bool / `false` | Allow startup to create a missing bucket only when explicitly enabled. |
| `TELESRV_STORAGE_LOW_SPACE_GUARD_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enable storage capacity admission. Startup requires a valid initial snapshot; refresh failures retain the last valid snapshot and log a warning. |
| `TELESRV_STORAGE_MIN_FREE_BYTES` | int64 / `1073741824` | Minimum local filesystem free bytes. It protects permanent files and upload parts for `localfs`, and local upload/spool space for `s3`; `0` disables this dimension. |
| `TELESRV_STORAGE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` | int64 / `0` | Optional S3 permanent-byte budget, counted over unique `object_key` values tracked by `file_blobs`; `0` disables it. This is not bucket billing usage. |
| `TELESRV_STORAGE_USAGE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | duration / `1m` | Capacity snapshot refresh interval; must be positive while the guard is enabled. |
| `TELESRV_STICKER_SEED_DIR` | path / `data/sticker-seed` | Sticker/reaction seed packages imported into documents, sticker sets, and blobs. |
| `TELESRV_STICKER_SEED_MAX_SETS` | int / `300` | Maximum regular sticker sets imported at startup; `<=0` means unlimited. |
| `TELESRV_GIF_SEED_DIR` | path / `data/gifs` | Optional built-in `@gif` startup directory. It accepts only `.gif/.mp4`, with at most 50 total entries; a missing directory is skipped, while changed same-name content or invalid media fails startup. Outputs use only the explicitly selected blob backend. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_PROMO_SEED_DIR` | path / `data/premium-promo` | Exported `help.getPremiumPromo` manifest, MP4 videos, and JPEG thumbnails. A missing directory keeps the no-video fallback; an existing invalid/incomplete directory fails startup. |

The language-pack file manifest is authoritative. To add a language, place `data/langpack/<pack>/<pack>_<lang>_v<version>.strings` and restart `telesrv`. The `pack` must match its first-level directory and may use the letters, digits, `-`, and `_` already used by Telegram (for example, `android_x`); `lang` is canonicalized to lowercase with hyphens (`pt_BR` becomes `pt-br`). Only the highest file version for each language is loaded. Effective content changes require a version bump; same-version effective mutations and version rollbacks stop startup. Removing a language file or an entire pack subdirectory atomically removes its database catalog and strings on the next restart. Startup streams a source-file SHA-256 first: unchanged files reuse the last atomic manifest without parsing strings or writing the database, while only new or changed files are parsed and replaced through PostgreSQL `COPY`.

Object storage is intentionally single-backend. Do not flip
`TELESRV_BLOB_BACKEND` until an explicit offline migration has copied the
objects, verified size/SHA-256, and updated `file_blobs.backend`.

## 5. Authentication, OTP providers, SMTP, and passkeys

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_DEV_AUTH_CODE` | sensitive string / `12345` | Fixed code used by `PHONE_CODE_DELIVERY_PROVIDER=development`; do not expose this default publicly. |
| `TELESRV_AUTH_CODE_TTL` | duration / `5m` | Login/registration/email verification code lifetime; must be positive. |
| `TELESRV_AUTH_CODE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | int / `5` | Maximum wrong attempts for one code/hash; must be positive. |
| `TELESRV_PHONE_CODE_LENGTH` | int / `5` | Random SMS-code length for the `webhook` phone provider; allowed range `4..10`. |
| `TELESRV_AUTH_CODE_PHONE_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `5` | Code issuance limit per normalized phone digest per rate window; `<=0` disables this dimension. |
| `TELESRV_AUTH_CODE_AUTH_KEY_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `20` | Code issuance limit per raw auth key per rate window; `<=0` disables this dimension. |
| `TELESRV_AUTH_CODE_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `10m` | Shared window for phone and auth-key issuance limits. |
| `TELESRV_PHONE_CODE_DELIVERY_PROVIDER` | enum / `development` | `development` uses fixed codes; `webhook` generates random SMS codes for login, registration, and phone changes. Both modes first commit the same code to the durable 777000 dialog for existing accounts; Webhook is additive. |
| `TELESRV_EMAIL_CODE_DELIVERY_PROVIDER` | enum / `smtp` | Delivery implementation for login-email and email setup/change codes: `smtp` or `webhook`. Existing-account login-email codes are first mirrored to 777000; setup/change remains provider-only. |
| `TELESRV_OTP_WEBHOOK_URL` | absolute URL / empty | Required when any provider selects `webhook`; see [otp-delivery.md](otp-delivery.md) for the fixed v1 contract. Any valid `http://` or `https://` host/IP and port is accepted; userinfo is rejected. |
| `TELESRV_OTP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | secret string / empty | Optional HMAC-SHA256 signing secret; enables `X-Telesrv-Signature` when non-empty. |
| `TELESRV_OTP_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` | duration / `5s` | Webhook HTTP timeout; must be positive when Webhook delivery is enabled. |
| `TELESRV_LOGIN_EMAIL_ENABLE` | bool / `false` | Enables login-email verification. SMTP settings are required only when the email provider is `smtp`. |
| `TELESRV_LOGIN_EMAIL_REQUIRE_SETUP` | bool / `false` | Forces accounts without a login email to configure one. Requires `TELESRV_LOGIN_EMAIL_ENABLE=true`. |
| `TELESRV_LOGIN_EMAIL_CODE_LENGTH` | int / `6` | Email verification-code length; allowed range `4..10`. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_HOST` | string / empty | SMTP server host; required when login email is enabled with the `smtp` provider. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_PORT` | int / `587` | SMTP port; must be `1..65535` when the SMTP provider is used. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_USERNAME` | sensitive string / empty | SMTP username. Also used as sender when `TELESRV_SMTP_FROM` is empty. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_PASSWORD` | secret string / empty | SMTP password. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_FROM` | email/string / empty | Envelope/header sender. Either this or SMTP username is required when login email is enabled. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_FROM_NAME` | string / `TELESRV_BRAND_PRODUCT_NAME` | Display name for login-email messages; when unset, it inherits the parent product display name. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_TLS` | enum / `starttls` | `starttls`, `tls`, or `none`; any other value fails startup. |
| `TELESRV_SMTP_TIMEOUT` | duration / `10s` | SMTP operation timeout; must be positive when the SMTP provider is used. |
| `TELESRV_PASSKEY_RP_ID` | hostname / `telesrv.net` | WebAuthn relying-party ID used for `rpIdHash`. Android Credential Manager requires alignment with hosted `assetlinks.json`. |
| `TELESRV_PASSKEY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | list / empty | Allowed WebAuthn origins. Empty disables explicit origin enforcement because Android APK-key-hash origins may not be known in advance. |

## 6. Maps, external media, previews, and uploads

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | secret string / empty | Mapbox Static Images access token for `upload.getWebFile` map previews. Empty uses deterministic placeholders. |
| `TELESRV_MAPTILE_CACHE_DIR` | path / `data/maptiles` | Disk cache for fetched map thumbnails, preserving byte-stable chunk downloads and limiting quota use. |
| `TELESRV_EXTERNAL_MEDIA_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables SSRF-protected fetching of external photo/document URLs. |
| `TELESRV_EXTERNAL_MEDIA_MAX_BYTES` | int bytes / `10485760` | Maximum response body per external-media fetch. Downstream treats `<=0` as the 10 MiB safe default. |
| `TELESRV_EXTERNAL_MEDIA_RATE_PER_MIN` | int / `60` | Global external-media fetches per minute. Downstream treats `<=0` as its default. |
| `TELESRV_WEBPAGE_PREVIEW_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables SSRF-protected Web-page metadata/image fetching for link previews. |
| `TELESRV_WEBPAGE_PREVIEW_MAX_BYTES` | int bytes / `5242880` | Response cap shared by preview HTML and image fetching. Downstream treats `<=0` as the 5 MiB default. |
| `TELESRV_WEBPAGE_PREVIEW_RATE_PER_MIN` | int / `300` | Global preview upstream requests per minute; one preview may make at most two requests. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_PART_TTL` | duration / `24h` | Retention for unassembled upload parts. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_PART_GC_INTERVAL` | duration / `30m` | Upload-part GC polling interval. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_PART_GC_BATCH` | int / `10000` | Maximum rows removed per upload-part GC batch. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_INFLIGHT_MAX_BYTES` | int64 bytes / `4194304000` | Per-user unassembled upload-byte cap; `<=0` means unlimited. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_INFLIGHT_MAX_PARTS` | int / `8000` | Per-user unassembled upload-part row cap; `<=0` means unlimited. |
| `TELESRV_UPLOAD_INFLIGHT_MAX_FILES` | int / `64` | Per-user concurrent unassembled `file_id` cap; `<=0` means unlimited. |

## 7. AI compose and business automation

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_BUSINESS_AI_PROVIDER` | string / `echo` | Business auto-reply generator. Allowed values are `echo`/empty (echo the triggering text), `template`/`quick_reply`/`quick-reply` (use quick-reply templates), or `ai`/`compose_ai`/`ai_compose`/`aicompose`/`kimi` (reuse the `TELESRV_AI_PROVIDERS` provider chain). This setting does not accept arbitrary provider names; for example, with Ollama set `TELESRV_BUSINESS_AI_PROVIDER=ai` and select the actual provider through `TELESRV_AI_PROVIDERS=ollama,local`. |
| `TELESRV_AI_ENABLED` | bool / `true` | Enables client compose rewrite/polish. False returns no tones and hides the entry. |
| `TELESRV_AI_PROVIDERS` | list / `local` | Ordered provider chain. Empty resolves to deterministic `local`, which makes no external request. |
| `TELESRV_AI_TIMEOUT` | duration / `15s` | Total timeout for one provider call. |
| `TELESRV_AI_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `20` | Per-account compose operations per window. |
| `TELESRV_AI_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `1m` | Compose AI rate-limit window. |
| `TELESRV_AI_LOG_CONTENT` | bool / `false` | When false, logs contain lengths/provider/status only. Enabling may expose user prompts and generated text. |
| `TELESRV_TRANSLATION_ENABLED` | bool / `true` | Enables `messages.translateText`; at least one remote AI provider is still required, and the local echo provider is never treated as translation. |
| `TELESRV_TRANSLATION_PROVIDERS` | list / empty | Selects provider names from `TELESRV_AI_PROVIDERS`; empty uses every configured remote provider. |
| `TELESRV_TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT` | duration / `15s` | Total timeout for one batch; batches contain at most 20 texts and use fixed provider concurrency of 4. |
| `TELESRV_TRANSLATION_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `60` | Per-account translated text items per window; a 20-item batch costs 20 to prevent provider-call amplification. |
| `TELESRV_TRANSLATION_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `1m` | Translation rate-limit window. |

Chat translation sends message bodies explicitly selected by the user to the configured external provider. Default logs omit content, but deployments should still disclose the upstream processor in their privacy policy. With only `local` configured, telesrv returns `TRANSLATIONS_DISABLED` instead of presenting source text as a translation.

For each name in `TELESRV_AI_PROVIDERS`, telesrv uppercases it, converts non-alphanumeric characters to `_`, and reads the following dynamic keys. Example: provider `openai-compatible` uses suffix `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE`.

| Dynamic setting | Type / default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_KIND` | string / derived from name | Adapter kind. Built-ins: `local`, `openai_responses`, `openai_chat`, `gemini`, `anthropic`. Names `openai`, `openai_chat`/`openai-compatible`/`openai_compat`, `gemini`, and `anthropic` map to their corresponding built-in kind. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_BASE_URL` | URL string / empty | Optional provider endpoint override. Required by some compatible/self-hosted providers. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_API_KEY` | secret string / provider fallback | Provider credential. For known providers it falls back to the process variables below. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_MODEL` | string / empty | Provider model identifier. External providers generally require it. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | int / `1024` | Requested output-token cap. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_TEMPERATURE` | float / `0.2` | Sampling temperature. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_OMIT_TEMPERATURE` | bool / `false` | Omits the temperature field for models/providers that reject it. |
| `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_THINKING` | string / empty | Provider-specific thinking/reasoning mode, normalized to lowercase; for example `disabled`. |

The following fallback keys are accepted from the **process environment only**. The env file rejects them because they do not start with `TELESRV_`: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. A provider-specific `TELESRV_AI_<NAME>_API_KEY` takes precedence.

## 8. Read-model and auth-key caches

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_TEMP_KEY_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` | int / `262144` | Router temporary→permanent auth-key binding cache capacity. |
| `TELESRV_TEMP_KEY_CACHE_TTL` | duration / `30m` | Recheck period; exact bind/revoke invalidation handles normal writes, while TTL covers cross-process/exception paths. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_ROW_CACHE_MAX` | int / `50000` | Shared channel-row cache capacity. `<=0` disables both cache and its LISTEN/NOTIFY listener. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_MEMBER_CACHE_MAX` | int / `100000` | Channel member/access read-model cache capacity; `<=0` disables it. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_DIALOG_CACHE_MAX` | int / `100000` | Viewer/channel dialog projection cache capacity; `<=0` disables it. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_BOOST_CACHE_MAX` | int / `100000` | Channel boost read-model cache capacity; `<=0` disables it. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_BOOST_CACHE_TTL` | duration / `10s` | Maximum stale window if a boost invalidation notification is missed. |

## 9. Outbox, push, limits, retention, and GC

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_WORKERS` | int / `4` | Concurrent outbox workers. Stable logical sharding preserves per-user pts order. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_BATCH` | int / `100` | Maximum rows claimed per poll. Larger batches improve throughput but increase DB/push bursts. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_INTERVAL` | duration / `200ms` | Delay between outbox claims. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_LEASE_TIMEOUT` | duration / `30s` | Time before a `dispatching` row can be reclaimed. Must exceed worst-case batch delivery time. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_POISON_RETENTION` | duration / `1m` | Diagnostic retention for terminal failed delivery heads; durable update events remain recoverable through difference. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOX_POISON_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` | duration / `15s` | Cleanup interval for terminal failed heads, independent of large-table retention. |
| `TELESRV_OUTBOUND_PUSH_TIMEOUT` | duration / `200ms` | Maximum wait for best-effort online update enqueue. |
| `TELESRV_SEND_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `30` | Per-account messages per send window; `<=0` disables send limiting. |
| `TELESRV_SEND_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `1m` | Send-rate window. |
| `TELESRV_CATCHUP_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `0` | Per-user difference/catch-up RPCs per window; `<=0` disables the gate. |
| `TELESRV_CATCHUP_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `1m` | Catch-up rate-limit window. |
| `TELESRV_CHANNEL_NUDGE_MAX_TARGETS` | int / `0` | Maximum targets for one channel fan-out nudge; `<=0` uses the built-in default. |
| `TELESRV_UPDATE_EVENT_RETENTION` | duration / `168h` | Durable update-log retention. Cleanup only removes events covered by protocol-safe watermarks/state. |
| `TELESRV_BOT_API_UPDATE_RETENTION` | duration / `24h` | Maximum Bot API update queue retention; acknowledged rows also have a shorter fixed grace period. |
| `TELESRV_ORPHAN_AUTH_KEY_RETENTION` | duration / `24h` | Minimum retention for handshake-created keys with no authorization/temp binding/active connection. |
| `TELESRV_RETENTION_INTERVAL` | duration / `1h` | General retention worker interval. |
| `TELESRV_RETENTION_BATCH` | int / `10000` | Maximum rows deleted by one general retention batch. |

Moderation report/evidence/case/decision/action/appeal rows are durable audit facts and are not removed by the
general retention worker. The same worker deletes expired sponsored impressions and appeal links in bounded seek
batches, and deletes auth-delivery diagnostics and client telemetry after their fixed 30-day privacy retention.
The raw appeal token is never persisted. Production reverse proxies must expose only `/appeal/<token>` to the
public-link listener, preserve HTTPS in `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, cap request bodies, and must not log the tokenized
path. `TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must resolve to that proxy for moderation freeze actions.

## 10. Premium and Stars development grants

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_BOT_USERNAME` | username / `premiumbot` | Reserved built-in Premium storefront username. A leading `@` is normalized away; invalid usernames fail startup. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_BOT_USER_ID` | int64 / `1250000015` | Stable built-in Premium bot user ID. It must be positive and must not collide with another system account. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_PLANS` | `months:days:stars` CSV / `3:90:750,6:180:1300,12:365:2400` | Seeds and synchronizes config-owned Premium plans. Months must be unique; all values are positive and bounded. Saving a row in the admin UI makes it admin-owned, so later restarts do not overwrite it. A catalog change bumps the durable plan version and invalidates outstanding old-price forms. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_GRANT_MONTHS` | int / `3` | Premium months granted to newly registered users; `0` disables new grants. Existing migration backfills are unaffected. |
| `TELESRV_STARS_STARTING_GRANT` | int64 / `1000` | Idempotent lazy starting Stars balance for all accounts; `0` disables automatic grant. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | duration / `1m` | Expired-premium cleanup/push interval. Read paths derive expiry independently. |
| `TELESRV_PREMIUM_SWEEP_BATCH` | int / `500` | Maximum expired premium rows processed per sweep. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | duration / `15s` | Local Star Gift offer/auction lifecycle sweep interval; no blockchain connection is made. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_SWEEP_BATCH` | int / `1000` | Maximum offer/auction/outbox work claimed per lifecycle sweep. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_TON_STARTING_GRANT` | int64 / `10000000000` | Nanoton granted idempotently on a user's first access to the internal telesrv TON ledger; `0` disables it. This is not an on-chain asset. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_TRANSFER_STARS` | int64 / `25` | Stars charged for a collectible transfer; `0` enables the free-transfer RPC. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_DROP_DETAILS_STARS` | int64 / `25` | Stars charged to remove a collectible's original sender/message details. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_OFFER_MIN_STARS` | int / `1` | Minimum Stars offer snapshotted for user-owned collectibles; `0` disables the offer entry point. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_STARS_PROCEEDS_PERMILLE` | int / `1000` | Seller share in Stars sales, in permille; the remainder is recorded as platform commission. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_TON_PROCEEDS_PERMILLE` | int / `1000` | Seller share in internal-TON sales, in permille; this affects only the local ledger. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_EXPORT_DELAY` | duration / `0s` | Delay snapshotted into `can_export_at` when a collectible is issued. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_TRANSFER_DELAY` | duration / `0s` | Delay snapshotted into `can_transfer_at`. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_RESELL_DELAY` | duration / `0s` | Delay snapshotted into `can_resell_at`. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_CRAFT_DELAY` | duration / `0s` | Delay snapshotted into `can_craft_at`. |
| `TELESRV_STARGIFT_CRAFT_CHANCE_PERMILLE` | int / `250` | Per-input local craft success contribution, capped at 1000 permille. |

### Composite account rating and collectible usernames

The account rating is gramsrv's own local score combining Stars received and spent, bounded account activity, and
moderation penalties; it does not claim to reproduce Telegram's private algorithm 1:1. The stored level is projected
through `userFull.stars_rating`, while `stars_my_pending_rating` and its activation date are exposed only to the
account itself so official clients can render the result without a patch. Profile reads only fetch a projection
already persisted by the background worker and reuse the existing 30-minute `userFull` projection cache; they never
recompute or write a rating synchronously. Every component remains separately explainable. Collectible (NFT)
usernames are minted by the operator; no external marketplace, wallet or chain node is configured or contacted.

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_RATING_ENABLED` | bool / `true` | Enables the local composite rating and client level projection. Disabled refuses rating writes and leaves client rating flags unset. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_PENDING_DELAY` | duration / `24h` | How long a local rating increase stays pending before it becomes the visible admin level. A decrease is always applied immediately, so a penalty is never delayed. `0` applies every change at once; must be `0..720h`. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_RECOMPUTE_INTERVAL` | duration / `15m` | Background recompute worker interval; must be positive. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_RECOMPUTE_BATCH` | int / `500` | Stale projections recomputed per cycle; must be `1..10000`. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_STALE_AFTER` | duration / `6h` | Projection age after which the worker recomputes a user; must be positive. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_STARS_RECEIVED_PERMILLE` | int64 / `1000` | Weight of Stars credited to the account (gifts, reactions, paid messages received), in permille of the raw amount. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_STARS_SPENT_PERMILLE` | int64 / `250` | Weight of Stars the account spent, in permille. Spending is a weaker signal than receiving. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_MESSAGE_SENT` | int64 / `1` | Score per sent message. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_ACCOUNT_AGE_DAY` | int64 / `2` | Score per day of account age. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_GIFT_RECEIVED` | int64 / `25` | Score per collectible gift held. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_MODERATION_CASE` | int64 / `150` | Penalty magnitude per upheld moderation case; the formula subtracts it. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_SCAM_PENALTY` | int64 / `5000` | Flat penalty magnitude for the scam flag. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_WEIGHT_FAKE_PENALTY` | int64 / `5000` | Flat penalty magnitude for the fake flag. |
| `TELESRV_RATING_ACTIVITY_CAP` | int64 / `5000` | Upper bound of the activity component so activity alone cannot outweigh Stars and moderation; `0` leaves it uncapped. |
| `TELESRV_COLLECTIBLE_USERNAME_URL_TEMPLATE` | URL template / empty | Landing URL recorded on a minted collectible username when the mint command carries no explicit URL. Empty derives `<TELESRV_PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/nft/username/<username>`. A configured template must be an absolute http(s) URL without userinfo; it may carry the `{username}` placeholder, and without it the name is appended as the last path segment. |

All rating weights are non-negative magnitudes and are validated even when the feature is disabled, so enabling it
later is not the moment a typo is discovered. The defaults above are exactly the shipped domain formula, so behaviour
is identical whether or not these keys are set. The final score is clamped at zero: penalties can erase a rating but
never invert it.

**Collectible username prices are stored in the smallest units of their currency**, because that is what
`fragment.collectibleInfo` carries: `amount` is "the total price in the smallest units of the currency (integer, not
float/double)" and `crypto_amount` likewise. So `USD 1000` is ten dollars, `TON 900` is 900 nanotons, and `XTR 1000` is
a thousand Stars, since Stars have no subunit. Clients divide by that exponent before drawing the price. The admin panel
is the conversion boundary: prices are typed and displayed there in whole currency units and converted on the way to the
API, so an operator never has to count zeros. An integration writing to `/api/actions/mint-collectible-username`
directly is talking to the API, not the panel, and must send smallest units itself.

### Official platform verification

Official verification is the platform badge (`user.verified` / `channel.verified`): an application is filed through the
built-in `@verifybot`, decided in the admin panel, and an approval flips that one flag on that one peer record. It is
deliberately not the third-party `botVerification` icon, where an outside organisation attaches its own mark. The
application row is the durable audit subject and is never deleted, only moved through its status machine.

Every eligibility check runs twice: once when the application is filed and again, against a freshly loaded snapshot, at
the moment of approval. A target must exist, carry a public username, be controlled by the applicant (bot owner, or
channel creator/administrator), not already be verified, not be deleted/frozen/scam/fake, and not be a built-in system
entity. A target that changed between submission and review is refused at the second gate, so the review queue cannot
be used to grant a state the submission path forbids. The flag itself is written inside the decision transaction, so
"approved" and "target verified" commit together.

Submitted links (website, social, press) are validated as plain http(s) URLs to public hosts: credentials, non-web
schemes, non-standard ports, loopback, link-local, private and other reserved address space are all refused. **The
server never fetches a submitted link** — not at submission, not during review, not from the admin panel. That is a
deliberate anti-SSRF decision, and validation is the only thing ever done to an applicant-controlled URL.

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` | bool / `true` | Enables official verification. Disabled refuses every verification use case explicitly; peers already carrying the badge keep it, because the flag lives on the peer record. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_ALLOW_USER_TARGETS` | bool / `false` | Accepts plain user accounts as verification subjects. Off by default: the official process verifies a public presence (bot, public channel, public supergroup), and a private account has nothing to check. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_REJECT_COOLDOWN` | duration / `720h` | Wait imposed on an applicant/target pair after a rejection, measured from the decision so a slow review never shortens it. `0` disables it; must be `0..8760h`. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_APPLY_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `3` | Applications one applicant may create per window. `0` disables the budget; must be non-negative. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_APPLY_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `24h` | Window for the creation budget. Must be positive whenever the limit is set: a positive limit with a zero window is a limiter that never refills. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_BOT_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `30` | `@verifybot` dialog rate per applicant, independent of how many applications are actually created. `0` disables it. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_BOT_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `1m` | Window for the bot dialog rate; must be positive whenever that limit is set. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_NOTIFY_INTERVAL` | duration / `15s` | Applicant-notification worker interval; must be positive. A decision commits with its outbox row, never with a message send, so delivery is a separate retrying cycle over durable rows. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_NOTIFY_BATCH` | int / `50` | Outbox rows delivered per cycle; must be `1..500`. |
| `TELESRV_BROADCAST_WORKER_INTERVAL` | duration / `3s` | System-broadcast worker interval; must be positive. |
| `TELESRV_BROADCAST_WORKER_LEASE` | duration / `30s` | Recipient claim lease used for crash recovery; must be positive and no more than `1h`. |
| `TELESRV_BROADCAST_MATERIALIZE_BATCH` | int / `200` | Maximum all-user recipient IDs materialized by one database keyset step; must be `1..1000`. IDs stay inside PostgreSQL. |
| `TELESRV_BROADCAST_DELIVERY_BATCH` | int / `50` | Maximum leased recipients delivered per cycle; must be `1..500`. Each message commits independently. |
| `TELESRV_VERIFICATION_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_USER` | int / `3` | Applications one applicant may keep open (draft, submitted, in review) at once. `0` disables the cap; must be `0..50`. |

The defaults ship the feature on with the official bar in place, so no existing deployment changes behaviour: user
accounts are not accepted, a rejection costs a month, and an applicant can neither flood the queue nor keep an
unbounded number of applications open. Every value is validated even when the feature is disabled, so enabling it
later is not the moment a typo is discovered.

### Third-party bot verification

Third-party verification is the other badge (`botVerification`, projected onto `user.bot_verification_icon`,
`channel.bot_verification_icon`, `userFull.bot_verification`, `channelFull.bot_verification`,
`chatInvite.bot_verification`, and advertised by `botInfo.verifier_settings`): an outside organisation running a
**verifier bot** marks peers with its own icon and description. The operator grants verifier status to a bot; the bot
then applies its mark through `bots.setCustomVerification`, or through the application queue its own dialog drives. It is
never a second route to the platform checkmark above, and the two mechanisms never read or write each other's state.

The icon is a custom emoji **document id**, and clients resolve it through `messages.getCustomEmojiDocuments`. An id
that names no fetchable custom emoji document therefore renders as *nothing at all*: the badge is invisible, the peer
looks unverified, and the only place the mark exists is the database. That is why the icon catalogue is operator-curated
and validated against real documents before anything is written — both when an entry is added and when a verifier is
granted an icon.

Every mutation re-derives "may this bot verify right now?" from the stored verifier row, so the per-verifier kill switch
takes effect immediately on the RPC path *and* on the review path: an application approved after the switch was flipped
is refused rather than granted. A verifier bot may only be driven by itself or by its owner, and an applicant may only
file for a peer it controls (bot owner, channel creator, or an administrator carrying `change_info`). Approvals and
revocations move the mark inside the store's decision transaction, so an approved application can never exist without
its mark.

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_BOT_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` | bool / `true` | Enables third-party bot verification. Disabled refuses every mutation explicitly (grants, revocations, applications, catalogue edits) while marks already granted keep projecting: blanking one verifier's badges is what its per-verifier kill switch is for. A deployment that wants the pre-feature wire shape leaves the service unwired instead. |
| `TELESRV_BOT_VERIFICATION_MAX_PER_VERIFIER` | int / `10000` | Peers one verifier bot may mark. Verifier status is granted per deployment rather than earned per peer, so an unbounded verifier would be an unbounded badge printer. Spent only on a *new* mark — an existing one stays re-describable at the bound. `0` disables the service bound and leaves only the storage bound, which is also the maximum accepted (`10000`). |
| `TELESRV_BOT_VERIFICATION_REQUEST_RATE_LIMIT` | int / `5` | Verification applications one applicant may file per window, across all verifier bots. Spent last among the creation checks, so a refused application costs no budget. `0` disables it; must be non-negative. |
| `TELESRV_BOT_VERIFICATION_REQUEST_RATE_WINDOW` | duration / `24h` | Window for the application budget. Must be positive whenever the limit is set: a positive limit with a zero window is a limiter that never refills. |

The application budget is deliberately looser than the official one (`TELESRV_VERIFICATION_APPLY_RATE_LIMIT=3`): a
deployment can run several verifier companies, and filing with a second one is not a retry of the first. Both keys are
validated even when the feature is disabled, and the per-verifier bound is checked against the storage bound, so a key
that cannot do what it says fails startup instead of being silently unreachable.

## 11. Private calls, group calls, TURN, SFU, and livestream

| Setting | Type / code default | Description and constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `TELESRV_CALL_RING_TIMEOUT` | duration / `90s` | Server fallback timeout for ringing/accepted private calls; should remain aligned with the client `callRingTimeoutMs`. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_TOMBSTONE_TTL` | duration / `60s` | Terminal-call tombstone window for idempotency and late RPC absorption. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_USER` | int / `4` | Maximum non-terminal private calls per user. Non-positive values are normalized by the phone service. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_REGISTRY_MAX_ENTRIES` | int / `10000` | Process-wide private-call registry hard limit. At capacity, new calls fail with `CALL_OCCUPY_FAILED`; established calls are never evicted by age. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_SIGNALING_MAX_BYTES` | int bytes / `65536` | Maximum payload for one `phone.sendSignalingData`. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_SIGNALING_RATE` | int / `50` | Signaling forwards per call per second; excess is silently dropped. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_EXPIRY_INTERVAL` | duration / `1s` | Call-expiry dispatcher polling interval. |
| `TELESRV_GROUPCALL_CHECK_TTL` | duration / `45s` | Participant liveness watermark expiry. Clients and the SFU reporter refresh it. |
| `TELESRV_GROUPCALL_SWEEP_INTERVAL` | duration / `10s` | Ghost-participant sweep interval. |
| `TELESRV_GROUPCALL_MAX_PARTICIPANTS` | int / `32` | Per-room participant cap for the current small-scale implementation. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables embedded TURN/STUN relay data in private calls. False falls back to LAN/P2P-only behavior. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_UDP_PORT` | int / `12400` | Embedded TURN/STUN UDP listen port; must differ from the SFU port and be allowed through the firewall. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_ADVERTISE_IP` | string / empty | Client-reachable relay address. Empty falls back to SFU advertise IP, then general advertise IP. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_SECRET` | secret string / empty | HMAC secret for TURN REST credentials. Empty creates a process-random secret; multi-instance/external coturn deployments must configure one stable shared secret. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_RELAY_MIN_PORT` | int / `12500` | Inclusive relay allocation port minimum. |
| `TELESRV_TURN_RELAY_MAX_PORT` | int / `12999` | Inclusive relay allocation port maximum; must not be below the minimum. Open the whole range in the firewall. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_TURN_CREDENTIAL_TTL` | duration / `6h` | Per-call TURN credential lifetime. |
| `TELESRV_CALL_FORCE_RELAY` | bool / `false` | Forces `p2p_allowed=false` to test TURN relay paths. |
| `TELESRV_SFU_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables embedded group-call media forwarding. False leaves signaling-only M0 behavior. |
| `TELESRV_SFU_UDP_PORT` | int / `12399` | Pion ICE UDPMux port; allow it through the firewall. |
| `TELESRV_SFU_ADVERTISE_IP` | string / empty | Client-reachable ICE candidate IP. Empty falls back to `TELESRV_ADVERTISE_IP`; loopback silently breaks real-device media. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_ENABLE` | bool / `true` | Enables embedded RTMP ingest plus ffmpeg segmentation for channel livestreams. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_RTMP_ADDR` | address / `:2400` | RTMP ingest TCP listen address. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_RTMP_URL` | URL string / empty | OBS-facing server URL. Empty derives `rtmp://<AdvertiseIP>:2400/live`. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_FFMPEG_PATH` | path/command / `ffmpeg` | ffmpeg executable path; the default resolves through `PATH`. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_WORK_DIR` | path / empty | Segment working directory. Empty uses the system temporary directory. |
| `TELESRV_LIVESTREAM_SEGMENT_KEEP` | int seconds / `32` | Per-stream segment duration/window retained in memory; non-positive values are normalized by the livestream service. |

## 12. Production minimum checklist

At minimum, production operators should explicitly review and override the development credentials/endpoints: PostgreSQL DSN and TLS, Redis password/network exposure, RSA key persistence, fixed development auth code exposure, Admin credentials/session key, OTP Webhook/SMTP secrets, AI/Mapbox API keys, TURN secret and firewall ports, public URLs/scheme alignment, and non-loopback SFU/TURN advertise addresses for real devices.
